# 🔤 Character Frequency Counter

This JavaScript program analyzes a given string and counts how many times each character appears. It:

- Converts the string to lowercase
- Removes all whitespace
- Counts the frequency of each character
- Sorts the characters alphabetically in the final result

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Input a sentence or phrase.
2. The string is converted to lowercase.
3. All spaces are removed.
4. The program loops through each character, counts how many times each appears, and stores that in an object.
5. The keys (characters) are then sorted alphabetically.
6. The result is displayed as a clean, sorted object.

## 🧠 Example

Input:

```js
"I Love JavaScript";
```
