# 💰 Steven's Tip Calculator (with Loops)

This project enhances Steven's Tip Calculator by introducing loops and array operations to efficiently process multiple bill values.

## 📋 Objective

- Create a program that calculates tips and totals for an array of bill values.
- Use loops to perform repetitive calculations.
- Practice working with arrays, loops, and functions in JavaScript.

## ✅ Features

- Calculates tips based on predefined tipping rules.
- Calculates total amounts (bill + tip) for each entry.
- Uses `for` loops to iterate through bill data.
- Includes a bonus function to calculate the average of totals.

## 🧪 Test Data

The following bill values are used for testing:

22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86, 52

## 💡 Bonus Challenge

A function `calcAverage` is included to calculate the average of any numerical array, such as the totals. This function:

- Adds all elements in the array.
- Divides the total sum by the number of elements to get the average.
