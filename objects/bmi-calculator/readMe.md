# BMI Calculator 🧮

This is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator built using HTML and JavaScript. It compares the BMI of two people—Mark and John—using object-oriented programming.

## 📌 What It Does

- Defines two objects (`mark` and `john`) with `fullName`, `mass`, and `height` properties.
- Each object has a `calcBMI()` method that calculates and stores the BMI.
- Compares their BMIs and logs a message indicating who has the higher BMI.

## 📁 Files

- `index.html` – Basic structure of the web page.
- `script.js` – All JavaScript logic and BMI comparison.
- `README.md` – Project description.

## 📚 Concepts Used

- Object creation
- Methods inside objects
- `this` keyword
- Conditional statements
- DOM Console output

## 💡 Example Output

Mark Miller's BMI (27.3) is higher than John Smith's (24.2)!
