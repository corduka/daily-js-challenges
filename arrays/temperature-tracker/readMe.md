Harrison is building a weather app that tracks the temperature of different cities. He wants you to help him calculate the temperature ranges.

Your tasks:

1. Create a function calcRange that takes an array of temperatures and returns the difference between the highest and lowest temperature.

2. Create an array cities containing the names of 3 cities: "New York", "London", and "Tokyo".

Create an array temperatures that stores the temperatures for these cities.

3. Use the calcRange function to calculate the temperature range for each city and print a message like this: "The temperature range in New York is 25Â°C."

Test Data:

New York: 12, 19, 27

London: 5, 10, 18
